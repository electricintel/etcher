Original attempt

Not stable enough to survive certain updates

I expected that it could be installed into a USB pendrive as a good alternative to a persistent live system, possible to update and upgrade without limits. But unfortunately a current update involving a new kernel and updating grub will make it fail to boot. So this system is not stable enough to survive certain updates. It is good only as an illustration of a method to make a bootable drive in UEFI as well as BIOS mode.
Stable alternatives

If you want a stable portable system, that boots in UEFI mode as well as BIOS/CSM mode, and in 64-bit as well as 32-bit computers, you can try One pendrive for all PC (Intel/AMD) computers. If you want a pendrive with a live and an installed system, you can try A new and so far successful attempt to create a stable portable system, that works in UEFI and BIOS mode.
Detailed instructions
Stable alternative 1

There are links to instructions how to make an installed system (typically in a USB pendrive) that works with UEFI and BIOS, and is small enough to work in an undersized 16 GB pendrive. This system is created from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 'Xenial' amd64 ('gamma' because it is beyond beta), and was simplified compared to the previous methods to make a stable installed system for UEFI and BIOS mode.

This link shows the post in an Ubuntu Forums tutorial, where the method was published:

Another new, simpler and so far successful attempt to create a stable portable system, that works in UEFI and BIOS mode

with a description how to make it 'from scratch' plus a link to uploaded compressed image files plus a small script to fix the GPT after cloning.
Stable alternative 2

The following link describes a new alternative with Lubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

Installation from a compressed image file

There is an easy way for you to get an installed Ubuntu system, that boots both in UEFI and BIOS mode, and you can use it in several cases. However,

    if you want to learn how to do it, or
    if you want to be sure of the content (and don't rely on me), or
    if you want hibernation, or
    if you want an encrypted disk (LVM with LUKS encryption), 

then you must do it yourself. (In the encrypted disk case, you must create the passphrase yourself during the installation.)
Compressed image file

It is straight-forward to install from a compressed image file using mkusb or mkusb-nox. Some tools may not work with compressed images of such large files. I tried in Lubuntu Xenial 32-bit daily to restore disk image with gnome-disks alias Disks, but it considered the size to be 3.5 GB, when it was 12 GB, so the image was truncated, Bug #1571255

After this cloning operation you should run gpt-fix in order to match the gpt data to the current drive size.

Torrent file

You can download a torrent file in order to get a compressed image file.

The dd_text_16.04-UEFI-n-BIOS compressed image file was made up to date, and a torrent file was uploaded in January 2017. This is the main choice, if you want to start with a light-weight system and install your own selection of program packages - desktop packages, server packages and application packages.

dd_text_16.04-UEFI-n-BIOS_2017-01-15_intel-4-pendrive-7.8GB.img.xz.torrent

There is a special version of the UEFI-n-BIOS system with the new dus installer. It can be used as a general purpose installed system too, in USB pendrives, memory cards (and also in SSDs and HDDs). Download the following torrent file, and use it to get the compressed image file.

dd_dus-lxde_16.04-UEFI-n-BIOS_2016-12-12_intel-4-pendrive-7.8GB.img.xz.torrent

in Linux

The target drive will be overwritten. Double-check which is the target drive, the drive you want to install into!

Use mkusb to install the system from the compressed image file.

See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb
gpt_fix in mkusb

The GUID partition table, GPT, is fixed automatically, if you use mkusb 10.6.6 or a newer version to install from these compressed image files. The functions gpt_zap and gpt_fix are built into mkusb.

If you use other tools, you need gpt-fix or to fix the GPT manually with gdisk. If this does not work, you probably need a bigger target drive (big enough to store all the partitions in the original source drive).
in Windows
Rufus

    We assume that you have downloaded a compressed image file according to the instructions above.

    Check that you have the current version of Rufus.

    Check that you have a tool that can extract the content from the compressed image file, and that can cooperate with Rufus, for example 7-zip.
    Run Rufus, and it can manage the whole process of extraction and cloning from the compressed image file to a USB pendrive.

    When you try to boot from the operating system in the target drive, there might be problems due to different size of the original drive size and the target drive size. This can be fixed in Ubuntu (and other Linux distros) by gdisk and often also by gpt-fix or gparted, if the target drive is big enough to store all the partitions in the original source drive. Otherwise you need a bigger target drive. 

Stepwise instructions

Check the download and clone the image in Windows according to the following page

Win32DiskImager/compressed-image_2_USB-or-SD

or according to this summary:

Download the following help programs

http://www.md5summer.org

https://www.7-zip.org

https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager

First check that the download was successful with md5summer according to the file md5sums.txt.asc.

Next extract the image file with 7-zip (It is also possible with winzip)

from dd_Ubuntu_16.04-gamma-UEFI-n-BIOS-4-pendrive-12GB.img.xz

to dd_Ubuntu_16.04-gamma-UEFI-n-BIOS-4-pendrive-12GB.img

The target drive will be overwritten. Double-check which is the target drive, the drive you want to install into!

Then write the extracted image file (without the ending gz) with win32diskimager

Win32diskimager looks for img files.
gpt-fix

After this cloning operation you should run gpt-fix in order to match the gpt data to the current drive size (unless you are using mkusb version 10.6.6 or newer versions of mkusb).

See more details at /stable-alternative#gpt-fix
Final system tweaks
Decrease wear for a pendrive

Add the mount option noatime in /etc/fstab

# / was on /dev/sdb3 during installation
UUID=4c518694-d97c-4910-bb7b-eeb6a6b73874  /  ext4  noatime,errors=remount-ro 0  1

Do not copy this line. Use your own data, only add noatime,

Turn off journaling

sudo tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sdxy

where x is the drive letter and y is the partition number of the root partition, for example /dev/sda3.

Maybe remove swap

It is also possible to remove the swap partition and the swap entry in /etc/fstab in order to avoid wear due to swapping.
Move swap and grow root partitions

Move the swap partition and grow the root partition to use the whole drive. See this link

https://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios/GrowIt.pdf

Login and password

When you have installed these systems from a compressed image file, and you reboot, you log in with the following user and password

user: guru

password: changeme

It is a good idea to change the password.
Links

If you want a stable portable system, that boots in UEFI mode as well as BIOS/CSM mode, and in 64-bit as well as 32-bit computers, you can try One pendrive for all PC (Intel/AMD) computers. If you want a pendrive with a live and an installed system, you can try A new and so far successful attempt to create a stable portable system, that works in UEFI and BIOS mode

It might be a good idea to try various systems and methods before deciding what to install. Try Ubuntu (Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, ...) before installing it
